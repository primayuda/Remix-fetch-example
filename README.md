## Development

Hit the run button to start the server in dev mode.


You can manually start the Remix development asset server and the Express server by running:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Development mode will automatically reload the server and the web app when you make changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

You can change the start script in `.replit` if you want to run your app in production all the time.
